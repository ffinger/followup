Title: Evidence based prioritisation of contacts to follow-up during infectious disease outbreaks
Version: 0.0.1.9000
Authors@R: person("Flavio", "Finger", email = "flavio.finger@lshtm.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description:
  Prioritise contacts to be followed for contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. Priorities are based on the date and type of exposure, and on the last time since follow up. The incubation period describes the probability of observing new symptoms on a given day. If several days have been missed from follow-up, these probabilities accumulate. Combined with the average probability of a type of contact being infectious, this provides a base for prioritising contacts to follow up.
